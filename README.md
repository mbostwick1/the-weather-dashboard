 ## Objective
 
 - To build a Weather Dashboard app including a user search field with a logged list, display of current day weather data, and a 5-day forecast using a third party weather API.

 This project helped me utilize all of the tools we have learned thus far with a heavy emphasis on AJAX calls, third party API, and jquery. The app is functioning correctly, however, when the page refreshes, the last city searched logs again.
